title: xConnect error when using Deploy Marketing Definitions tool
---

#### In this post

Installing xConnect to an 8.0 > 9.0.1 Sitecore upgrade resulted in some duplicate items in the content tree. This stops the Deploy Marketing Definitions tool from completing.

#### Problem

I had nearly completed an installation of xConnect with Sitecore 9.0.1, in xp0 configuration. Toward the end, I used the `Control Panel > Analytics > Deploy Marketing Definitions` tool. It thought for a little while, then blew up, asking me to check the logs. When I did, I found this message:

```csharp
8876 16:00:59 ERROR One or more exceptions occurred while processing the subscribers to the 'item:saving' event.
Exception[1]: System.InvalidOperationException 
Message[1]: Multiple items were found by alias 'Field Completed'

```

#### Fix

There were two Field Completed items (with the same template), in my tree at `master:/sitecore/system/Settings/Analytics/Page Events/*`

Checking the create dates, I see that the items in the Forms folder are newer. I guess the earlier ones are an overhang from our previous Sitecore 8 installation. In any case, I just renamed the older versions to {0} Old and now the Deploy Marketing Definitions tool completes. Iâ€™m now going to remove the duplicate items entirely, and ensure any links are redirected to the new version.
